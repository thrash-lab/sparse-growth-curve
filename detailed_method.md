To have the detailed method run step by step with illustrations, see [1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb)

First, we have an array of cell densities ```Xi``` (can be any units, like cells/mL, OD, CFU/mL, etc.) and an array for the corresponding aquisition time ```ti```.
