To have the detailed method run step by step with illustrations, see [1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb)

The sparse-growth-curve method takes the array of cell densities```X``` and the corresponding aquisition time ```t``` as input.
