# sparse-growth-curve
Analysis of bacterial growth curves with relatively low temporal resolution.

1. To learn how I parse an individual growth curve (cell density vs. time), see "1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb" ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb))
