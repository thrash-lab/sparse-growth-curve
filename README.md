Analysis of bacterial growth curves with relatively low temporal resolution ([introduction in detail](https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/introduction.md)). The code is written in Python in **Google colab notebooks (to-do: write the detail instruction of how to use it)** (Jupyter notebook).

1. To learn how I parse an individual growth curve (cell density vs. time), see [1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/1_one_growth_curve_analysis.ipynb)
2. You can put multiple and related growth curves in one individual excel (.xlsx) file. As examples, you can see the ".xlsx" files in https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/tree/main/Growth_curve_data_example. For how an individual file is parsed, see [2_one_file_multiple_growth_curves_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/2_one_file_multiple_growth_curves_analysis.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/2_one_file_multiple_growth_curves_analysis.ipynb)
3. See [3_multiple_files_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/3_multiple_files_analysis.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thrash-lab/sparse-growth-curve/blob/main/3_multiple_files_analysis.ipynb), for running multiple growth curves files in batch.
